Palaeo Ice Sheet Modeller at the British Antarctic Survey

I have previously worked at the University of St Andrews (UK) as a Postodcoral Researcher, focusing on [ice-ocean interactions in Greenland fjords](https://glaciology.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/projects/fjordmix). My main research interests are:

- 💻 numerical modelling
- ❄️ 🏔️ glaciology (both modern and paleo time scales)
- 🌊 ❄️ ice-ocean interactions
- 🏔️ 💻 🌊 bridging the gap between the modelling and "empirical" communities, no matter the time scale, ice sheet, or whether it's on- or off-shore!

I have been going back and forth between Matlab and Python for the last 10 years, mainly for reasons beyond my control...
